>>>>>> Always use map funtion to loop the data 
e.g. 
arr.map((info) => do something///);

>>>>>> always pass "key" whenever you use loop to assing unique id to all child 
becuase react will always try to render the full tree if no key is assign and 
if key is there then only the changed node will render other would as-is.

key sohuld always unique and if key is not avialable then use index instead but use some uniqueness atleast.
but index won't suggested by react as good code practice
